Our Current 3DMIPCDVIZ Tools and Instructions:

- After you’ve installed our application (installation guide link) and you’ve imported any files you want to view (file importer guide link)
- Make sure they’re in the appropriate folder and get your headset plugged in and ready (link to oculus set up)!
Make sure the ‘guardian’ is also set up correctly so you start in the right place in our viewing room!

Go ahead and open up the application called CalVr

The terminal/command line may pop up and stay up, don’t panic! just wait

After a meditative few seconds, 
A small window into the virtual world will appear. 

But wait!
Before you pop into your headset ….



take a look at your controllers: 


In a moment, when you are inside the app, a ray will extend out of your controller that acts as your pointer to the menus and tools you can interact with!
Use the trigger (your pointer finger) to select text and tools from our menus.
For all selecting from menus: point at the text or icon and click once.
To use the sliders: point at the bar and either click or click and hold
Use dials by pointing, clicking and holding. While holding down the trigger you can then rotate your wrist to turn the dial and move the bar to a more precise value !
Click and hold the the grip buttons(your middle finger) to grab and menus, clipping plane, and the volume itself
Use the Y or B button while pointing at the volume to bring up options such as scaling. Double click while pointing at the room for options such as movement or hiding the room.     (I recommend only focusing on the scale option for now)
For adjusting the volume scale click and hold over the scale button, keep holding the button and move the controller right or left to make it larger or smaller

Now that you have an understanding of the controls
Go ahead and put on your headset. 

- The 1st order of business when you enter the room is to load in the volume you’d like to see!
Under the Volumes menu click on New Volume. Another menu will pop up showing you the folder you placed your files in earlier. 
- Choose the series name you’d like to load, and then select the stack of images. 
(Currently the dots above all of the items in your folder allow you to “go up” the directory, or back up to the less specific folder above it. If you accidentally go back, just navigate back to the folder you placed the files under).

Your volume should now be visible! 
Main Color Menu:

Besides the new volume you can now also see a bunch of handy color customization and viewing options!
- This color optimization menu is primarily for mapping the values of the original dicom files to different colors for visual clarity. This way, for example; less important values can be made transparent and more important pixels (or areas of higher pixel density) can be emphasized with  a different color.
- The features of this menu are:
Flip the volume sagittal, axial, and coronal
Increase the brightness of all the final values of the volume
The contrasts minimum and maximum values can be adjusted
 (I recommend mostly adjusting the minimum until you can’t see less important values on the very edges of the volume)
The triangles on this menu represent mathematically how the dicom values are being mapped to the volume values. 
Moving the triangle is choosing the section of pixels to transform, how much, and by how much.
The center of the triangle, at the highest part, is the most solid, whereas the outer corners of the triangle are the most transparent. The gradient above the triangle shows which color values you’re mapping to, the bar below it shows the final transparency of those mapped values.
Consequently, center, widths, height etc. all change the triangles shape in that way, so please experiment until you can see clearly what you would like to!


Color Preset Menus:
From here you can:
Add more triangles
Hide triangles from view
Save all your triangles for next time
Load up previously saved ones
Volume Tools Menu:
To get rid of any tool simply click their icon again
Select the cutting plane icon and move your controller back and forth to cut through the volume. 
Select the camera icon to take a screenshot. Move it like you would the volume or menus with the grip button, set it to where you’d like and select the capture button
The ruler icon will allow you to place the beginning of the ruler. It will start at the base of your controller and extend while you move as long as you are holding down the button. 
Please Enjoy all of these tools to quickly and thoroughly explore your new 3D volume!
